# INTLUG exersize files

For the bash and regex talk we'll have a set of exersizes. These are files you can access to get the baseline instead
of having to type from the shared slides.

You need to be running BASH and at least have it available/installed for these examples to work.

To execute - make the scripts executable with "chmod +x <script-name>" or use "bash ./script-name".
